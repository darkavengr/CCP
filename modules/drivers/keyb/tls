these keys are generated on connection to the server, where the
	- Uses symmetric encryption
Allows the sender to prove that they are who they say they are
	- The identity of the sender is proven using certificates

Gives privacy

Data integrity
	- Prevents eavesdropping by allowing detection
	- Message integrity check
